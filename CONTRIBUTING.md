## Development Standards

Our project adheres to the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for
collaboration.
Issues are managed on GitHub Discussions, with plans to transition them to Jira.

### Branch Naming Conventions:

- `test/{jira-issue-number}/{optional-description}`
- `feature/{jira-issue-number}/{optional-description}`
- `refactor/{jira-issue-number}/{optional-description}`

> Example : `feature/AYS-1/add-role-delete-tests`

### Pull Request Naming Conventions:

- `{jira-issue-number} | {header-for-summary-of-development}`

> Example : `AYS-1 | Add role delete tests`

Here are some additional standards to keep in mind:

- Link your feature branch to the corresponding GitHub issue.
- `main` branch is protected.
- PR should be linked to the relevant issue within the GitHub Project.
- Only one code owner's approval is needed for merging feature branches.
- PR should be squash-merged to avoid merge commit history.
- PR should pass build and necessary tests before merging.
- Releases should be tagged with a version.
- Commit messages should be subjectless.
- Resolve comments within the PR by the commenter.
- PR should be concise and address one thing.
- Avoid including secret/credential information.
- Code should comply with existing coding standards; no new standards should be introduced without justification.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs, have feature requests, or want to provide general feedback, please feel free to open a
discussion
in the "afet-yonetim-sistemi" repository. When creating a discussion, please provide as much detail as possible,
including:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Any error messages or logs

## Submitting Changes

When submitting changes, please ensure the following:

- Your code adheres to the project's [code style guidelines](#code-style).
- The documentation has been updated, if necessary (see [Documentation](#documentation)).
- Your commits are clean and have clear commit messages (see [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)).

## Code Style

To maintain a consistent codebase, please follow the existing code style used in the project. If necessary, refer to any
code style guidelines mentioned in the repository.

## Commit Messages

Writing clear and descriptive commit messages is essential for the maintainability of the project. Follow these
guidelines when writing commit messages:

- **Be Clear and Concise:**
    - Ensure the subject line clearly summarizes the change. While it’s useful to start with a verb (e.g., "Fix," "
      Add," "Update"), the main goal is to make sure the message is clear and easily understandable.

- **Provide Additional Details:**
    - Include additional details in the commit message body if necessary.
    - Explain the reason for the change and provide context to help reviewers understand the impact and purpose of the
      change.

- **Squash and Merge:**
    - We use the Squash and Merge strategy for integrating pull requests. This method combines all commits in a pull
      request into a single commit before merging.
    - As a result, the pull request title becomes the final commit message. Ensure the title is descriptive and
      accurately reflects the overall change.
    - Example pull request title: `Enhance Error Handling in Payment Processing`

- **Example Commit Message:**
  ```
  Add new endpoint to handle user authentication

  - AYS-0 : Add new POST endpoint to handle user login
  - Include validation for user credentials
  - AYS-0 | Authentication Flow Has Been Refactored
  ```

By following these guidelines, you contribute to a clear and understandable project history, facilitating easier code
reviews and collaboration.

## Documentation

Clear and up-to-date documentation is crucial for the project's users and contributors. If your contribution introduces
new features, modifies existing functionality, or requires changes to the documentation, please make the necessary
updates.

Follow these guidelines for documenting your changes:

- Update the relevant documentation files to reflect your changes.
- Write clear and concise explanations.
- Use code examples or screenshots, if appropriate, to enhance understanding.
- Proofread your documentation to ensure it is accurate and free of errors.

## Community Guidelines

In addition to the technical aspects, it is important to follow the community guidelines to maintain a positive and
inclusive environment for all contributors.

- Be respectful and considerate of others' opinions and ideas.
- Be open to feedback and willing to collaborate with other contributors.
- Avoid personal attacks, offensive language, and harassment.
- If you notice any inappropriate behavior, report it to the project maintainers.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can work together to build a welcoming and productive community.
